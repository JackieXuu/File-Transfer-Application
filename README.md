# File-Transfer-Application
### Introduction

I implement a simple file share application using TCP Socket APIs and UDP Socket APIs.
The peers can upload or download files from other peers. The submitted files includes
four parts, which are TCP and UDP C/S model, P2P model and RDT3.0. Each part has its own UI design ti
make operation easier and clearer.



### Environment

This application is implemented in Java language using Eclipse Java Neon.
The working environment is built on Windows 10. To evaluate these files, make sure
that java and Eclipse Java Neon is correctly installed in your system.
